This plugin provides a new tag for the Contact Form 7 Plugin. It allows the usage of a reCAPTCHA field provided by the BWP reCAPTCHA Plugin.

== Description ==

Contact Form 7 is an excellent WordPress plugin and the CF7 BWP reCAPTCHA Plugin makes it even more awesome by adding reCAPTCHA capabilities.
In the past this functionality has been provided by a recaptcha module offered by the developer of CF7 which this plugin is based on. 

The Problem with the module was that it had to be copied into the modules directory every time the Contact Form 7 plugin was updated. 
That was bad.

This plugin can be installed and mantained independedly from the CF7 plugin and its modules.

= Requirements =

* You need the [Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/ "Contact Form 7 Plugin") plugin to be installed and activated.
* You need the [BWP reCAPTCHA](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bwp-recaptcha/ "Better Wordpress reCAPTCHA Plugin") plugin to be installed and activated.

= Settings = 

The settings of the BWP reCAPTCHA plugin are used by default. You can change that behaviour on the settings page of the plugin under:

*BWP reCAPT* -> *CF7 Options*
